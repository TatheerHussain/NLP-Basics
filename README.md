## Welcome to the Natural Language Processing in Python Tutorial!


### 1. Download Anaconda
I highly recommend that you download [the Python 3.7 version](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

### 2. Download the Jupyter Notebooks
Clone or download this [Github repository](https://github.com/adashofdata/nlp-in-python-tutorial), so you have access to all the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb extension) in the tutorial.

### 3. Launch Anaconda and Open a Jupyter Notebook

*Windows:*
Open the Anaconda Navigator program. You should see the Jupyter Notebook logo. Below the logo, click Launch. A browser window should open up. In the browser window, navigate to the location of the saved Jupyter Notebook files and open 0-Hello-World.ipynb. Follow the instructions in the notebook.

*Mac/Linux:*
Open a terminal. Type ```jupyter notebook```. A browser should open up. In the browser window, navigate to the location of the saved Jupyter Notebook files and open 0-Hello-World.ipynb. Follow the instructions in the notebook.

### 4. Install a Few Additional Packages

There are a few additional packages we'll be using during the tutorial that are not included when you download Anaconda - wordcloud, textblob and gensim.

*Windows:*
Open the Anaconda Prompt program. You should see a black window pop up. Type `conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud` to download wordcloud. You will be asked whether you want to proceed or not. Type `y` for yes. Once that is done, type `conda install -c conda-forge textblob` to download textblob and `y` to proceed, and type `conda install -c conda-forge gensim` to download gensim and `y` to proceed.

*Mac/Linux:*
Your terminal should already be open. Type command-t to open a new tab. Type `conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud` to download wordcloud. You will be asked whether you want to proceed or not. Type `y` for yes. Once that is done, type `conda install -c conda-forge textblob` to download textblob and `y` to proceed, and type `conda install -c conda-forge gensim` to download gensim and `y` to proceed.
